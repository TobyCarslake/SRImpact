## Needs
Bubble chart?
grid based on outcomes - 13 columns and 6 rowss interventions y axis

DFAT region
5 categories

Pub year range
4 categories

Age group
4 categories

Interventions 
6 categories

Each intersection needs to total the studies that meet each criteria

use grid to declare cells use column width for titles of columns

It will be 8 rows 14 columns
create a .{} in css for each cell then use that to insert the circle size and hover details for each cell

create arrays for each cell that grabs intervention type and then the categorys of DFAT region, age group and year of pub

maybe something like 


cell1 = [];
let cell1 = function () if (class intervention x and class dfat region)    then push to cell1
cell1 length = size of circle
cell1.key.link[each] add that to the inner html of cell 1 hover
